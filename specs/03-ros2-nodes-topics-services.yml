module_title: "ROS2: The Robot's Nervous System"
overview: "This chapter delves into the fundamental communication mechanisms in ROS2, focusing on nodes, topics, and services. Students will learn how to create ROS2 nodes, implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns, and design service-based interactions. The chapter covers the ROS2 architecture principles, lifecycle management, and best practices for designing robust communication systems in robotic applications."

why_it_matters: "Understanding ROS2 communication primitives is essential for building distributed robotic systems. Nodes, topics, and services form the backbone of ROS2 architecture, enabling modular, scalable, and maintainable robot software. Mastering these concepts allows developers to create complex systems where different components can communicate efficiently and reliably, forming the 'nervous system' of the robot."

key_concepts:
  - "ROS2 Nodes: Independent processes that perform computation and communicate with other nodes"
  - "Topics: Asynchronous, many-to-many communication channels using publisher-subscriber pattern"
  - "Services: Synchronous, request-response communication for direct interaction between nodes"
  - "ROS2 Client Libraries (RCL): Language-specific libraries that provide ROS2 functionality"
  - "DDS (Data Distribution Service): Middleware that enables communication between ROS2 nodes"
  - "Node Lifecycle: The states and transitions that govern node behavior"
  - "Quality of Service (QoS) Profiles: Configuration parameters that define communication behavior"
  - "Names and Namespaces: Hierarchical naming system for ROS2 entities"

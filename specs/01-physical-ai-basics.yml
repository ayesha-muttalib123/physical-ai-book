module_title: "ROS2: The Robot's Nervous System"
overview: "This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, exploring the intersection between artificial intelligence and physical systems. Students will learn about embodied intelligence, the importance of sensorimotor learning, and how AI agents interact with the physical world through robotic platforms. We'll cover the theoretical foundations that underpin physical AI, including perception-action loops, environmental interaction, and the challenges of operating in real-world environments with uncertainty and noise."

why_it_matters: "Understanding Physical AI basics is crucial for developing intelligent systems that can operate in the real world. Unlike traditional AI that operates on abstract data, Physical AI must deal with embodiment, physics, sensor limitations, and dynamic environments. This foundation is essential for creating robots that can navigate, manipulate objects, and interact safely with humans and environments. Physical AI principles form the backbone of applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, and human-robot interaction."

summary: "Chapter 1 establishes the foundational concepts of Physical AI, emphasizing the importance of embodiment, sensorimotor integration, and the challenges of operating in real-world environments. Students learned about perception-action loops, environmental affordances, and morphological computation. Through ROS2, Gazebo, and Isaac examples, they gained hands-on experience with physical AI implementations. The practical examples demonstrated how these concepts translate into real robotic applications, preparing students for more advanced topics in subsequent chapters."
